# 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with Background Music 🎶

## 🚀 **How It Works**

1. **Choose Your Weapon**: You, the player, can choose between **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**. Each choice has its strengths and weaknesses.
    - Rock beats Scissors 
    - Paper beats Rock 
    - Scissors beats Paper 

2. **Enemy Makes a Choice**: After a few seconds, the enemy will also choose one of the three options.  
   ⚠️ **If you don't choose anything in time, the enemy automatically wins the round!** ⚠️

3. **Victory or Defeat**: The game compares your choices and declares a winner:
    - **You win** if your choice beats the enemy's choice.
    - **Enemy wins** if their choice beats yours.
    - **It's a tie** if both of you make the same choice.
